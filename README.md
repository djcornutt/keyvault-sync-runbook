Ideas and initial code from [Sync Azure Keyvault Secrets and Certificates between Vaults](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Sync-Azure-Keyvault-f6efc502) by @brwilkinson in TechNet Gallery.

Files in the `Test` directory are used for testing the runbooks, or for setting up from scratch.
